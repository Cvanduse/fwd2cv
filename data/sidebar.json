Despite growing up on Motown, I actually prefer listening to Hip Hop and Jazz.  Definitely, rooted deep in the Motor City, but I still love to get out and explore different cities and experience new cultures.  Currently, cruising through lifeâ€™s adventures, capturing moments and always moving forward.",
